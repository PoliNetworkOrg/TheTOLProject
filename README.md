# The TOL Project

## Goal of the project

This website is supposed to give students that want to enroll at Politecnico di Milano a new way to train for the TOL admission test.  
The project is entirely managed by students, it is not affiliated with Politecnico di Milano in any way.

## Repo structure

- This repo contains the source code of the web app hosted at [tol.polinetwork.org](https://tol.polinetwork.org/).  
  This is supposed to be the main repo, and any issue or discussion should be opened here.  
  Every time the `main` branch is updated, the website preview build will automatically update too: the preview build is hosted [here](https://PoliNetworkOrg.github.io/preview/PoliNetworkOrg/TheTOLProject/branch/main).  
  Every PR will also get its own preview deployed by the CI workflows, and the link will be posted as a comment by the bot.
  This repo hosts a [GitHub Pages website](https://polinetworkorg.github.io/TheTOLProject/) too, which currently redirects to the `main` branch preview.
- The [website repo](https://github.com/thetolproject/thetolproject.github.io) only contains the production build from the [`stable`](https://github.com/PoliNetworkOrg/TheTOLProject/tree/stable) branch, automatically generated by the [`deploy` workflow](https://github.com/PoliNetworkOrg/TheTOLProject/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml).  
  Any issue and/or proposal related to the website should be submitted to this repository.
- The [database repo](https://github.com/PoliNetworkOrg/TheTOLProjectData) that only hosts the compiled database.  
  As with the website repo, any issue with the database should be reported here.
