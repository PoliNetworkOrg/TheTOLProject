### Reporting an issue

To report an issue with the website please [open a new issue](https://github.com/PoliNetworkOrg/TheTOLProject/issues/new/choose).

### Sumitting code changes

After cloning the repo and installing the dependencies, you can run a local instance with the `npm start` script: any changes you make to the source code will be shown in your local instance.  
If you want to test out the resulting build, you can use `npm run build`.  
Make sure to commit your changes to a branch and test them by running `npm test`. Additional tests will also be run by GitHub Actions when you push to the repo or open a PR.  
After you've tested your code open a new PR and wait for a repo maintainer to review it.
