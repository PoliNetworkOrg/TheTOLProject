    "main": "In order to be admitted to the Engineering school of Politecnico di Milano (PoliMi), the aspiring freshmen must pass the admission test (TOL). <br /> Among the resources that PoliMi offers for free to prepare, you can find: the Politest, a collection of commented and solved exercises, the DOL, an online demo with a limited number of questions, and two complete self-assessment tests (pdf with questions, xls with exact answers). <br /> <br /> Thus, we did not have a complete, web-based TOL simulation, that is, in the same environment in which the future freshmen will take the admission test. <br /> We have set ourself the goal of creating a complete and free TOL simulation, in order to provide aspiring freshmen with a familiar environment in which to practice, very similar to the one they will encounter at the admission test. <br /> The project is fully managed by students, from developing the web application to creating the TOL questions.",
